## Methodology

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

- **TTFT** (Time to First Token): wall time from request send to first content chunk on the wire.
- **TPOT** (Time Per Output Token): decode time / output tokens, excluding prefill.
- **ITL** (Inter-Token Latency): gap between consecutive output chunks.
- **Prefix cache hit rate**: token-level, read from the backend's Prometheus counters (start/end delta). Not request-level.
- **Verdict thresholds**: TTFT GOOD ≤3s / OK ≤10s; throughput GOOD ≥30 tok/s / OK ≥15 tok/s.
- **Compaction**: when context exceeds ``max_context_tokens``, history is cleared and the user prefix is incremented.
- **Decode throughput** isolates generation speed from prefill (excludes TTFT).
- **Wall-clock per-user throughput** uses real start/end timestamps, not summed per-request latencies.
